# 1337 Cursus Projects

This repository contains some of my projects from the 1337 school cursus (42 Network). Each project represents a step in the learning journey, building fundamental programming skills in C and system programming concepts.

## Projects Overview

### 📚 **Libft**
My first C library containing reimplementations of standard library functions plus additional utility functions. This forms the foundation for all subsequent projects.
- **Skills**: C programming basics, memory management, string manipulation
- **Key Functions**: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_memalloc`, linked list operations

### 🖨️ **ft_printf** 
Recreation of the famous `printf` function with support for various format specifiers.
- **Skills**: Variadic functions, format parsing, type conversion
- **Supported formats**: `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`, `%%`

### 🔄 **push_swap**
Sorting algorithm project using two stacks and a limited set of operations to sort integers efficiently.
- **Skills**: Algorithm optimization, complexity analysis, stack operations
- **Challenge**: Sort with minimum number of operations

### 💬 **minitalk**
Client-server communication program using UNIX signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2) to transmit strings.
- **Skills**: Signal handling, inter-process communication, bitwise operations
- **Concepts**: Client-server architecture, signal-based messaging

### 🖥️ **minishell**
A simplified bash shell implementation with basic shell functionality.
- **Skills**: Process management, parsing, built-in commands, environment variables
- **Features**: Command execution, pipes, redirections, signal handling

### 🎮 **so_long**
2D game using the MiniLibX graphics library - a simple collection game with map parsing and player movement.
- **Skills**: Graphics programming, game logic, event handling
- **Features**: Sprite rendering, collision detection, map validation

### 🎯 **cub3d**
3D game engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, implementing raycasting techniques.
- **Skills**: 3D graphics, raycasting algorithm, texture mapping
- **Concepts**: 3D mathematics, performance optimization, graphics rendering

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: C
- **Graphics**: MiniLibX (for graphical projects)
- **Build System**: Makefile
- **Standards**: 42 Norm coding standard

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Strong foundation in C programming and memory management
- Understanding of system programming concepts
- Experience with graphics programming and game development
- Problem-solving and algorithm design skills
- Code organization and project structure

## 📖 Getting Started
Each project directory contains its own Makefile and specific instructions. To compile any project:

```bash
cd [project_name]
make
```
